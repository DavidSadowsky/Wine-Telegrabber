All-In-One Zamorak Wine Telegrabber for Old School Runescape using Java and the RSPeer API.

## Setup

Follow this [guide](https://docs.rspeer.org/docs/setting-up-dev-environment) on the RSPeer website to set up your development environment.

Create a new package called `org.yourname` or something along those lines. This package will hold all of your scripts and it's not necessary if you're only going to be using one script; however, if you plan on downloading/adding more, this is the structure that I like to use.

Inside `org.yourname`, clone this repository. Then, build module `project name` (you can name the intellij project whatever you'd like) and your JAR executable should be automatically added to the RSPeer client.

## Support

Currently supported locations:

- Falador

Support for the wilderness temple will be added in a future release.
